## Intro
This is the git repo for my web game, currently titled "Clone Adventure"! This is my current personal project and is a remake of a pygame game I started in 12th grade! The game is (mostly) functional in raw JS/CSS but I wanted to remake it using the new frameworks I'm learning! (React and Tailwind CSS)
